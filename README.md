# Ignis Engine

This engine is going to be made up from the ground up using C and Vulkan.

The word "ignis" is a Latin noun that primarily means "fire". It can also be translated as "flame" or "heat" in English.

# Plan
Ignis will be a 3D engine from the start, with most of it built from scratch with explanations along the way. The series starts off as more of a tutorial to get up and running, with explanations becoming higher level as things progress to keep the pacing up. The project is fairly new and since I only get times on the weekends it will take some time to get it to an exciting stage.

## Platform support
Windows and Linux are both supported from the start.

## Start
To get started, clone the repository: `https://github.com/D1abol1cal/Ignis`.

You will need to have Clang and the Vulkan SDK installed:
 - Clang: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
 - Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/

## Roadmap
 - Fully 3D engine with various lighting models and material types available (Basic 3d lighting, Physically-Based Rendering, etc.)
 - Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux to start, with Mac forthcoming)
 - Multiple rendering backends:
   - Vulkan first
   - Eventually adding OpenGL and DirectX and potentially Metal
 - Suite of editor tools
 - Asset/Game Code hot-reload support
 - Physics
 - 2D/3D Sound
 - Full-fledged UI system
 - Event system
 - Standard Keyboard/Mouse input along with eventual GamePad input

## Goal
The goal here is simple, to have a game engine capable of making games.
